# BADGESH
terminal achievement thingy.

## how it looks
![alt text](https://github.com/duart38/BADGESH/blob/main/images/notf1.png?raw=true "Logo Title Text 1")

TODOs:
- keep in memory DB and only save to disk on exit code (interval fallback in case power outage)?
- [x] more tailored achievement messages (maybe with some jokes in there) -> Add as an exported const as a module from a server (like github)
- [x] make commands constant network delivered?
